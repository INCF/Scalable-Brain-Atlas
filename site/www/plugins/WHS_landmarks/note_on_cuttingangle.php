<h3>Landmark definitions and the Waxholm space (WHS)</h3>
The landmark definitions and corresponding slice images are based on a mouse MRI taken at Erlangen University.
<br/>Four differences between the 'WHS mouse' and 'Erlangen mouse' MRI data should be noted:
<ol>
<li>The WHS mouse was perfused with a contrast agent before MRI.</li>
<li>The Erlangen scans were done at 4.7T, WHS at 9.4T.</li>
<li>The Erlangen scans show not only the brain but also a large portion of the head.</li>
<li>The WHS and Erlangen coronal sections have cutting angles that differ by about 24 degrees.</li>
</ol>
The difference in cutting angles is illustrated in the two figures below. Red/left is the Erlangen mouse with a cutting plane through the interpeduncular nucleus; yellow/right is the corresponding image for the WHS mouse.

As a consequence, if in the definition two landmarks happen to be on the same slice, then they may be on different slices in WHS 2011.
This is the case for two pairs of landmarks: {KM, PAG3} and {IP, H} in the middle, left and right variants.
<br/>
In WHS the limulus-like PAG is visible much earlier (more posterior) than KM, which is on "the last slice with obviously separated cortex-halves".
<br/>
The same applies to IP and H: IP is more posterior than H, which is "where the 2 hippocampus parts meet".
<p>
So, remember:<br/>
<b style="color: #800">If the definition shows several items in one image, these features might be not on one and the same slice.</b>
