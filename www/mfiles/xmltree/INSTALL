INSTALLING XMLTree
------------------

This toolbox requires MATLAB 5.3 or later and should work on all
platforms.

1) Download <xmltree.zip> from here:

   <http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/xml/>

2) Extract files from the zip archive:

>> unzip xmltree.zip

3) Add the new path to Matlab (assuming you extracted the toolbox
in '/home/flandin/matlab/'):

>> addpath('/home/flandin/matlab/xmltree/');

Note that the directory @xmltree doesn't need to be added in Matlab 
path, since it's a class directory. 

4) XMLTree package uses one mex-file for the parsing of XML data: 
this mex-file is provided for Windows, Linux and Solaris platforms.
If you need to compile it for your own architecture, the command is:

>> cd /home/flandin/matlab/@xmltree/private/
>> mex -O xml_findstr.c

If never this compiled function doesn't work or behaves badly, 
comment the line #define __HACK_MXCHAR__ at the beginning of the 
file, and compile it again.

5) You can now launch demonstration mfiles:

>> xmldemo1
>> xmldemo2
>> xmldemo3


If you've got troubles when installing this XML toolbox, you can 
send me an email (Guillaume@artefact.tk) explaining precisely your
problem.
Suggestions for improvement and fixes are always welcome, although 
no guarantee is made whether and when they will be implemented.
