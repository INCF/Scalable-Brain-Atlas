Scalable-Brain-Atlas
====================

Source code of the Scalable Brain Atlas website (scalablebrainatlas.incf.org).

This code includes only one template, DB08.
All other templates are available directly from the SBA website.
For example, for template PHT00, you find the acronym to full name mapping file at:
http://sba.incf.org/PHT00/template/acr2full.json

A list of available files is in preparation, for now you can look at the source
in /main/coronal3d.php
